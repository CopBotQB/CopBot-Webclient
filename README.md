# CopBot

A set of programs designed to discourage cheating within Quizbowl (https://www.naqt.com/about/quiz-bowl.html).
This program consists of two parts. A client, and a web dashboard. This repository houses the code for the web dashboard, which can also be accessed at https://copbot-e0c62.web.app/

## Usage instructions

### Download (DOWNLOAD_LINK):
Download and launch the app. The app will query you to perform a google authentication. If no record is found of you in the CopBot database, it will redirect you to  the web dashboard to create an account. Perform the Google and Discord authentication, using the same E-mail you used to sign up for both services. Then, log in to your client again and you are good to go.
